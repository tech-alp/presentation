- Seas are areas of strategic importance for the security, economy and trade of countries. Since our country is surrounded by seas due to its geographical location, its effectiveness and safety at sea are of great importance.

- In this presentation, we will discuss the details of our UMV project. 
and we will focus on the points where we will make a difference. Our aim is to protect our seas 
to increase security and strengthen our defense capabilities 
to offer innovative solutions.

# Problem Analysis

Seas are important areas of strategic importance for countries. However, there is a need for constant surveillance and security for the effective conduct of coast guard operations. The high operating costs and human safety risks of traditional marine vehicles make it difficult to meet this need.

Problems: 

- üí∏ High Operating Costs

- üîí Human Security Risks

<div>

<p>

- Defense Industry
> The target audience in the defense industry includes military forces, navies, and coast guard units. Particularly, there may be a high demand for UMVs for military purposes such as border protection, reconnaissance, and surveillance missions. The defense industry market is directly linked to global defense spending and budgets allocated for naval operations, indicating a potential revenue in the billions of dollars.
